<p><strong><em>tl;dr</em></strong> : I was looking for a way to set the maximum value of a variable but without using locks (because locks suck) this is my rant about it using CAS (compare-and-set operation).</p>
<p>We deal a lot with multi-threading and performance is something which we cannot part with. We needed a way to record the maximum latency for the application. The throughput is about 15-20K requests/secondÂ  and we needed to monitor and set the maximum latency value (since the start of the application) amongst other things, without affecting the performance.</p>
<p>There were a bunch of solutions that I found online that used locks, but locks although conceptually simple are performance bottleneck. Naturally, I turned to the Java concurrency package for reference and realized that <a title="Doug Lea" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Lea" target="_blank">Doug Lea </a>had this algorithm which he used for <a href="http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/6-b14/java/util/concurrent/atomic/AtomicLong.java#AtomicLong.getAndIncrement%28%29" target="_blank">AtomicLong.getAndIncrement()</a> which used CAS operations. I used the same algorithm to set the max value and so far it appears to work.</p>
<p>Following is the code I used, with comments, hope it helps !</p>

<pre>       
       /**
	 * Try to update the max value without using a lock.
	 * This method is thread safe.
         *
	 * @param val the values to be updated to, if greater than given atomic.
	 * @param atomic the {@link AtomicLong} to be checked
	 * @return true if updated, false if not updated.
	 */
	public static boolean setMax(final long val, final AtomicLong atomic)
	{
		while (true)
		{
			final long currentMax = atomic.get();

			if (currentMax &gt;= diff)
			{
				/* if the current value is greater than diff we break */
				return false;
			}

			/*
			 * Here we check whether other thread has already modified the
			 * currentMax value, if yes setSuccess=false or else setSuccess=true
			 * in which case we the following operation will update the
			 * maxLatency value to the diff.
			 */
			final boolean setSuccess = atomic.compareAndSet(currentMax, diff);

			if (setSuccess)
			{
				/*
				 * we managed to update the max value, no other thread changed
				 * it, we are don here.
				 */
				return true;
			}

			/* some other thread got in the way, go back and do the drill again. */
		}

	}
