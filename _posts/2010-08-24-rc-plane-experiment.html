excerpt: My experiment with RC planes
---
<p><em><strong>E</strong></em>very now and then I get hooked up with new hobbies, this time it was RC planes. I used to love playing with electronics when I was a kid. Sometimes I was encouraged to play with electronics (when our Philips tape recorder would bail out on us or when our mixer and grinder would cease working) manytimes I was not allowed to touch them (our television set, telephone and wrist watches to name a few).</p>
<p>Anyhow, I was surfing over the internet and came across the website <a href="http://diydrones.com/">DIY Drones</a> they do pretty cool stuff and I was impressed by the things that these guys do, I really wanted to buid a drone for myself and my quest for the drones began. I soon understood that it was a significant undertaking for a person like me, who has little or no understanding of how airplanes fly (except for the fact that they fly on Newton's laws and bernoulli's principle - I knew it before I saw Friend's ! ).Â  So I started with a very basic step - buying an airplane.</p>
<p>Now this was not a simple thing, I probably spent about a week trying to figure out which plane is good for me, not to mention that I wanted an economic plane. After a lot of research I brought a RTF <a href="http://www.nitroplanes.com/j3pipercub.html">J3 Piper Cub</a> from Nitro Planes (they were offering it for cheap during that time $70)<br />
It was a ready to fly plane, which basically means that it flies out of the box. The RC transmitter and receiver is an important part and I wanted it to be the best, as I am relying on it to control my plane which will have my precious payload (GPS, Camera etc.) ! So I brought a Spectrum Dxe5 controller,<br />
for $99. It is a 5-channel controller, a 5-channel controller means you can control 5 functions of the plane using the transmitter/receiver, those 5 functions are<br />
Refer: http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/alr.html</p>
<ol>
<li>The Motor (Throttle) - which generates the thrust.</li>
<li>Ailerons - used for maneuvering the plane left or right.</li>
<li>Rudder - used to navigate the plane left or right (rudder is sufficient to change the direction of the plane, aileron are not must but are very desirable for acrobatic maneuvering).</li>
<li>Elevator - used to life the plane and slow it down during landing.</li>
<li>Retractable Landing Gear.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will scrap the FM transmitter and reciever that came with the plane. The plane that I brought for the time being will be only using 3 channel 1,2 and 3. I can't wait for it to arrive so that I can start<br />
playing with it.</p>
<p>I also brought a GPS module (SiRF 2 chipset) for logging the raw NMEI data of my flight, I am planning to interface it with my Aurduino module and use it<br />
as my personal data logger. I will keep posting about the development.</p>
<p>Happy Flying</p>
