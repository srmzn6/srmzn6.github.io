<p>Out of curiosity I had built myself a GPS Datalogger, I was able to get the raw NMEA data out of it but it only provided information regarding my position and time. I wanted to calculate the velocity of a vehicle at a given location and plot a graph of distance Vs velocity. I used the following calculations to calculate the distance between the two coordinates on the Earth's surface. By dividing that distance with time I was able to calculate the velocity in KMPH at a given location.﻿</p>
<p>To calculate the distance between two Latitude and Longitude coordinates, I am using the 'Havesine' formula. Haversine formaula calculates the great-circle distance between the two points i.e. the shortest distance given between the two points on the earth's surface. It calculates the "as-the-crow-flies" distance between the points ignoring any terrain.</p>
<p>Here's the formula (angles are assumed to be in Radians)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">R = Earth's radius = 6,371 Km<br />
Dlat = latitude2 - latitude1<br />
Dlong = longitude2 - longitude1<br />
a = sin²(Dlat/2) + cos(latitude1)*cos(latitude2)*sin²(Dlong/2)<br />
c = 2.atan2(√a, √(1−a))<br />
d = R*c</p>
<p><strong>Haversine formula (Mathematical explanation)</strong></p>
<p>haversin (d/R) = haversin(θ2 - θ1) + cos(θ1)cos(θ2)havesin(Δλ)<br />
Where:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">havesine(θ) = sin²(θ/2) = (1−cos(θ))/2<br />
d is the distance between two points on a sphere<br />
R is the radius of the sphere<br />
θ1 is the latitude at point 1<br />
θ2 is the latitude at point 2<br />
Δλ is the longitude seperation</p>
<p>The arguments to the haversine function are assumed to be in Radians.<br />
so, to calculate the distance we have</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">d = R haversine(inverse)(h) = 2Rarcsin(√h)</p>
<p>Where h = haversin (d/R)</p>
<p>My implementation of the above formula is in Java, I be publishing the code as soon as I get some free time.<br />
I can email the code if anybody wants it urgently.</p>
