<p>Well, it's been a long time I wanted to set up a SSH service on my Mac. Every time I did it I got slammed by robots trying to brute-force my password. Not that I have a week password but it ate a lot of my bandwidth and not to mention the processing power. So, I decided to make a series of changes to make my box more secure.</p>
<p><strong>Change the default SSH port to something other than 22 :</strong></p>
<p>From a security point of view defaults are a big no-no. So, here are the steps to change the default SSH port from 22 to something else. Now, for some reason its not as easy as changing /etc/sshd_config file as it is with Linux. Anonymous, has written a nice <a title="Changing Default SSH port in Mac" href="http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20050707140439980" target="_blank">article</a> on this, I will duplicate some of it here.</p>
<p>1) Using Terminal go to the file /etc/services</p>
<p>2) Find the line where SSH port value is defined, by default it should be 22 (for TCP and UDP)</p>
<p>3) Modify the number from 22 to any number between 1024-65535.</p>
<p>4) Restart the machine for the changes to take effect.</p>
<p>One small thing to remember about ports is that values 1-1024 are privileged ports and avoid using those values. Any value between 1024-65535 should be acceptable but larger values are invalid.</p>

<p><strong>Disable Password Logins and enable Publickey Authentication:</strong></p>
<p>I would rather disable password logins on my internet facing box. Its Game Over for me if my password is compromised or gets brute-forced.</p>
<p>To disable password logins follow the following steps:</p>
<p>1) Using terminal go to the file /etc/sshd_config</p>
<p>2) Open the file with your favorite editor (vim in this case)</p>
<p>sudo vim /etc/sshd_config</p>
<p>3) Uncomment (remove #) the line which says '#ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes' and change it to following</p>
<p>ChallengeResponseAuthentication no</p>

<p>4) To enable publickey login, uncomment the lines</p>
<p>PubkeyAuthentication yes</p>
<p>AuthorizedKeysFile      .ssh/authorized_keys</p>
<p><a href="http://sandeepmore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-07-at-10.42.04-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-239" title="Screen shot 2011-04-07 at 10.42.04 PM" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-shot-2011-04-07-at-10.42.04-PM-300x64.png" alt="Publickey on" width="300" height="64" /></a></p>
<p>This will enable you to login using publickey which is a nice and secure way to log in from outside your network.</p>
<p>5) If you want to turn on Tunneling then you can change the line '#PermitTunnel no'  to 'PermitTunnel yes'</p>
<p>6) Once you are comfortable with all the changes type 'Esc:wq' which means Write the file and Quit.</p>
<p>We don't need to restart the SSH server on mac OS X as services are  started and stopped dynamically by launchd. Configuration changes are  immediate.</p>
<p><strong>Creating SSH Public-Private Key:</strong></p>
<p>To be able to login from outside the network we need to set up public private key pair. The private part remains with you all the time ( never ever share it !) and the public part goes to whatever server you want to be able to be log in from.</p>
<p>Here you will be creating public-private key pair on the client machine (e.g. iPhone or PC) from which you want to access your SSH server securely. In my case I want to access it from iPhone using iSSH. So I will be creating the keys on my SSH server itself and copy the private part to my iPhone and public part to my server.</p>
<p>Following are the steps to create public-private key pair:</p>
<p>1) Fire up the terminal and type 'ssh-keygen'</p>
<p>2) Select the default location and hit enter.</p>
<p>3) Select a strong passphrase and hit enter.</p>
<p>4) Confirm the passphrase and hit enter.</p>
<p>5) Your key should be ready now.</p>
<p>6) Login into the server as a user you want to login using SSH. Create a folder .ssh under the home directory (if  it dos not exist)</p>
<p>mkdir ~/.ssh</p>
<p>7) Copy the public part of the key (id_rsa.pub) to that .ssh folder</p>
<p>cp ~/Desktop/id_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/</p>
<p>8 ) Rename id_rsa.pub file to 'authorized_keys' (this is an important step !)</p>
<p>mv ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</p>
<p>9 ) Change the permissions on the public file so that its read only for the user</p>
<p>chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</p>
<p>10) Copy the private part of the key (id_rsa) to the machine from where you want to be able to login (client).</p>
<p>11) Try log in from the client machine.</p>
<p>ssh myssh.com</p>
<p>Awesome, you got yourself a secure SSH server ! make sure you do not share the private key with anyone and make sure you protect it.</p>
<p>For some reason if things do not go your way check the output of</p>
<p>ssh -vvv myssh.com</p>
<p>and see what you get. If you are still having issues try repeating above steps, if that does not help post a comment may be I can be of some help.</p>
<p>There is a very nice post describing above steps and Kerbros authentication for SSH <a title="The Mac OS X Server Admin" href="http://www.themacosxserveradmin.com/2010/10/secure-ssh-with-snow-leopard-server.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
