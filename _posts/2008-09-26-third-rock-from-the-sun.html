<div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:'times new roman';"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">S</span></span>urprises are always around the corner for us, not necessarily pleasant ones. Things change and so do circumstances and so do people. There are some times when you are so happy that world seems to be a smaller place, every person around the corner and across the street smiles at you, also there are times when you are so unhappy that world seems to be just a lifeless stone, just a 'third rock from the Sun', everyone seems to be angry at you and it feels like sky is collapsing on you. Just one of those times when you wish you had power to be invisible, just gone, disappear into the thin air, away from this material world. <br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:'times new roman';"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:'times new roman';">But alas ! this ain't any fairy tale, its a real world and we have to play by the rules. Sometimes I look in the mirror and can't tell who I really am and who everyone else believes me to be. its like walking a thin line between 'what is' and 'what could be'. Confused perplexed yet struggling to convenience myself I am alright. When will we stop running, running from the truth. Stop pretending to be what we are not. I always hated hypocrites, but then I found myself doing the same, shocking but true. Worst part is when you realize it, its like waking up from a nightmare and finding out you are in a much worst situation ! be as it may.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:'times new roman';"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:'times new roman';">Its like life takes you up on a ladder, up and up then suddenly you realize that there is nothing there for you and now its a long way down. All you got was castles of sand, throne of twigs, and your crown of ice was melting. Guess what its times for us to wake up. Time to come out of fairly tale... just to realize that you are about to enter another. </span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:'times new roman';">I have one question, when will it stop ? Fairy tales and castles ...... </span></div>
