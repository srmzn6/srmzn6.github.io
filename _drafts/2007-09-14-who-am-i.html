<p>Well a milliion dollar question, I was born in a small town in central India (I hate to divide India into parts but some of my friends  won't understand without such useless words) called Kurduwadi, and it still remains the magical place for me, also its my mothers home town, thats why its a little closer to my heart.<br />             Grew up like a wasted kid wasting my time playing and hardly studing, a nuisance to my parents. Playing for me was   destruction for others, for me sometimes it was learning !! like how a watch works, it was impossible for me to know unless I broke it. So my parents decided to divert my attention to subjects like drawing and study. As a result I was more inclined towards drawing and sketching, by the time I came to college I started sketching my Professor's cartoon behind my notebook and it didn't go unnoticed !!. Its difficult to be a artist in India and survive, atleast my parents thought so. For every kid in India it was a unwritten rule that he has to be an Engineer, or if he is bright a Doc. I followed the same path and ended being an Engineer ! a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Telecommunication.<br />             My life took a U turn from the day I entered hostel and suddenly I started understanding what was taught in class (for the first time ever !!).<br />oh boy those were the good old days ! lying on the sand (not beach sand ! building construction sand, if you know what RCC (Reinforced Cement Concrete) is ) and watching the moon and sharing with friends what we used to feel about those mysterious girls who never used to notice us. Singing in bathroom like we were the only one in the world to sing. Going to college with shoes polished and tie in 36 Degree C / 98 Degree F was a fun !!<br />             Playing cricket was a matter of pride and when we won the finals for three consecutive times we ruled the place,<br />we were heros .. even though that ment low termwork and less grades we accepted it ! But still I could manage in studies by Gods grace.<br />             College got over and I was to face the real world ! well, I was not ready for it but I had to, thought I could do lots of things but could not ! I got into TCS and made some very dear friends for life time and flew to US ! well lets see where life takes from here.....</p>
