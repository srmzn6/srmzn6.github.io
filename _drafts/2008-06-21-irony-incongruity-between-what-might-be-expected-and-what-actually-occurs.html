<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'times new roman';">I</span></span></span>t was just other word I used to throw at people, a wise guy sort of word. But I have started to realize that Irony is not just a figure of speech or a word used to describe your power of comparison to others; but for me irony has become my reality.</p>
<p>In my previous blog I signed off on a note that we are happy in our ignorance. We tend to cherish our past, ignore the present and worry about future. I was impressed by the movie Kung Fu Panda – not the animation part of it but the kind of approach it took towards life. We all have it in us but we seek it in others. What an irony!</p>
<p>Following are examples of how ironic life has been to me.<br />When I was in India I longed to go abroad to see places to see how people are on the other side of the world, catch the setting sun in ‘The west’ ! And here I am in Mid-West longing to go home and to catch the 'Rising sun' in my hometown ! Burgers and Pizzas had always lured me, but never did Puran Poli, chat or Vada Pav they were integral part of my life, say for e.g. air you breath, you always take it for granted till one day you run out of it !!.</p>
<p>Grass is always greener on the other side! When I was working I wanted to go to school and when in school I was tired of student life. I wanted to do real job. And now when I am doing a real job, I want to go back to school!</p>
<p>Yesterday when I was walking down the streets of Olathe – a small town in Kansas, I saw lush green fields waving with the wind, there were unbroken fences, properly maintained wild grass, sidewalks beautifully carved with curbs for pedestrians, fields with no ‘Trespassers  will be prosecuted’ signs or barbed wired fences. It was a treat for my eyes. I was thinking to myself these people are so lucky to enjoy such a wonderful natural wealth, back home the scene is opposite. But as I was thinking; it occurred to me that to appreciate this beauty you need to be from a place which lacks it! and then I said to myself how fortunate I was. An American is less likely to appreciate it as he takes these things for granted. He might find something else attractive which I might take for granted!

<div>In my opinion it explains why the grass is ‘ought’ to be greener on other side. Our civilization would come to a standstill if we thought ‘My grass is greener than yours!’ and people stayed in theirs homeland admiring it. </p>
<p>Same word different perspective - ‘Irony’.</p>
<p>Life never stops surprising you and may be that’s what I like about life always new challenges new ways to explore. I know I might get tired one day but then at-least while breathing my last breath I would be glad that I could appreciate what I was given, even my last breath ! </p></div>
