I had so many dreams and still what I am today is not at all close to even one of those things I wanted to become. In other words I did not expect to turn out this way. I wanted to be a  pilot,an astronaut,a cricketer, an artist, a businessman .... as I grew up I began to realize that none of this was even closer to the skills I had, or I was made to believe I had. Well, I thought I was good in drawing and fair in playing cricket. In studies I was zero absolute zero, my parents never thought I would study till Post Graduation, for them me passing SSC (10th standard) was a milestone !</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:small;"><br /></span></div>

Wherever I go there is an element of surprise. Surprises are always around the corner for me, few good most of them bad. I have my own beliefs about good and bad but I am about to shatter them. Now I am beginning to realize that there is no good or bad, there is only action and reaction. And good or bad is what your society thinks, if we go by the universal frame of reference there is no good or bad thing. Isn't that astonishing, world without good bad. Its just like one man's bread is other man's poison.</p>

The more I think the more my memory takes me in my past. I love those childhood years spent in 'Gold Finch Peth', Solapur, my adolescence in 'Awanti nagar', where I started realizing that may be I can be friends with girls and the whole chemistry of my physical body was altered, not to mention the economic recession was still in progress. But still, I was satisfied, with all my friends with all my wrong notions, with all my false beliefs, I was at-least happy.</span></span>
