<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><b><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;">L</span></span></i></b>ast weekend was the most entertaining and fruitful weekend of all.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">Friday's are fun, I had decided to do a whole bunch of things when I return home from office but then<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">I was so exhausted by work that the moment I landed home I crashed. Gargi, dragged me to hobby lobby<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">she wanted to purchase some stuff related to painting. I reluctantly dragged myself helplessly to Hobby Lobby, I was under the impression that<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">it was just another store where girls like to hang out and purchase stuff like flowers and useless decorative items. It turns out that<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">it was a nice store and had something for everyone, I was especially attracted to the painting and drawing section.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">That part of the store appealed to the artist in me. I had totally forgotten that I could paint. I used to sketch in my spare time but painting wasn't my cup of tea.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">I was always intimidated by colors,&nbsp; I was always bad in choosing colors. All my friends knew how to mix colors, they literally knew names of each and every shade of color that was available at our school. It was daunting. I could get away with drawing a decent picture but painting, it was hard. I also had some limitations, I had sweaty hands, my hands used to sweat every time I took a pen, pencil or brush, so painting was a bit challenging for me.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">My last memories of painting goes back to the year 1996-97 almost 11 years from now, I had painted a soldier sitting on a horse. For me that was a masterpiece,<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">it was one of the best drawings I had ever drawn. I used to keep all my paintings in my drawing book. Unfortunately my mom thought I might not concentrate on my<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">studies and was getting distracted by drawing ( which was indeed true ! ), so she disposed my drawing book. Unfortunately for me it had all my drawings the best and the worst.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">For some time I thought she was hiding it later I discovered it was gone ! and I felt a cold chilling sensation down my spine, I still feel it when I think about it. I got over it and started<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">concentrating on my studies. Fortunately for me and my parents I was able to score good in board exams and I could get myself&nbsp; a seat in the engineering college ! I was happy by the thought I was going to be an engineer, but then somewhere deep within me I had buried a small tiny artist in me. Probably his voice was too weak for me to hear or may be my thoughts were&nbsp;fogged by my family, friends and relatives expectations. Somewhere down the path I lost the small kid in me holding a brush and a pallet.</div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">Fortunately, I found the same kid last weekend and was delighted to meet him. This time though, I have decided I will give him all the attention he needs and make sure<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">he won't be lost again in this fast paced and ever-changing world !</div>
