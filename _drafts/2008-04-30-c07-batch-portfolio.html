<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Same thing is true about my TCS ILP batch. We were a bunch of randomly chosen 'gifted' people from all parts of India brought together at Coimbatore (the less gifted were sent to Trivendrum !!), off-course we had to clear the physically grueling selection procedure by TCS !! </span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">During my stay at Coimbatore I made lots of friends, many of them for life time. Apart from the extremely hectic schedule that TCS put us through for 47 days we enjoyed the weekends and the lab sessions which were purposefully scheduled at dawn or midnight. </span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Monu, one of my greatest friend and philosopher took pains to put the following portfolio together about C07 batch, one of the eight other batches. </span></div>

<blockquote></blockquote>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:'times new roman';"> There is a retired teacher leading a quiet and peaceful life. On each birthday his friends, relatives and especially old students come to visit him who include VIPs like K.J.Yesudas etcetera. The full day consists of such visits but he has reserved the evenings for a special routine that has continued for years. The time reserved for this is not used for anything else, not even to meet relatives who are late.  He retires into his room, starts reading and laughs uncontrollably for hours. His family members have got used to this but an outsider may wonder what caused this quiet old man to giggle and laughs like a teenager. The cause of his happiness is the comments, incidents and short messages written by his friends about him during his student days. It is as if he has traveled back in time to those wonder years and can see his entire student life pass by once again. That person is my college friend Dileep’s Grandpa. Since I wanted all of us to enjoy our  life as DJ’s Grandpa, I decided to pen some things.</p>
<p>Wishing you all a hilarious 75th birthday-Monu Abraham Joy</p>
<p>ATTENTION</p>
<p>THE VIEWS AND OPINIONS EXPRESSED HERE ARE FROM THE AUTHORS SOLE VIEW POINT. THEY ARE IN NO WAY CONSTITUITING A COMPLETELY PERFECT CHARACTER SKTECH (Especially in the case of “Interesting Associates” , whom I ,regretfully, did not get to know well) .<br />IF YOU WANT  TO KNOW THEM BETTER, SPEND TIME WITH THEM  !!!</p>
<p>JUST BECAUSE SOME ADJECTIVES HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO ONE PERSON DOES NOT IMPLY THAT OTHERS DO NOT HAVE SIMILAR QUALITIES.</p>
<p>(THE NAMES ARE IN RANDOM ORDER AND DO NOT SHOW ANY BAISING OF THE AUTHOR.IF SOMEONE OR SOME ATTRIBUTE WAS LEFT PLZ EXCUSE AS IT WAS DUE TO SEVERE TIME CONSTRAINTS)</p>
<p>I present to you C-07 !!!</p>

His project mates owe a lot to him!<br />• Gave me the taste of “Agra ka Petta” for the 1st time.<br />• Adores the Mumbai Underworld .<br />• A quite character that moves in his own circle of friends.<br />• Don’t see him studying but scores big time.<br />• Has his priorities well defined.<br />• Sadly only some lucky people in C07 got to know the real Amit.<br />• His laptop was the only source of entertainment in Navratna.<br />• Amit and me hate regionalism very much. We don’t consider a person on his place of origin        before breaking the ice. If we find him/her comfortable to be with we talk, if not, we don’t,          even if he comes from the same place.</p>
<p>3. KRISHNA ( kind kisna)</p>
<p>• Reserved guy .<br />• Demands anwers for his doubts in class.<br />• Moves in a close circle of friends.</p>

<p>9. DARSHAN (baby darshan, Darrrrrshan)</p>
<p>• Darling of C07.<br />• Linux ka bap.<br />• Some of us will never forget learning German with him for the end term.<br />• Has a deadly stomach lock in his arsenal, which he regularly focuses on me.<br />• Does not trim his nails. So one day I showed them to Seetha maam…(Now you know why I am    called “Dirty Monu” by Arogya)</p>
<p>10.SAI SURESH (Raghuvaran-Tamil actor,PL)<br />• Spitzzzzz (German)!!!!<br />• Finds redoing modules completely, easier than debugging,even for others.<br />• Handles most of the doubts in lab.<br />• “Appears” to be a quiet bookworm but we all know the terror he can be.<br />• I can go on and on so I am stopping PL.<br />• ( Remember me when you form a team to go to US)</p>

But he doesn’t care and laughs anyhow.<br />• Is more “dirty” than you think.</p>
<p>15. SHAJI  (CRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRr)<br />• Handled a thankless job efficiently.<br />• If he can control his anger and tension there is no stopping him.<br />• Has high dreams and I hope he gets them.<br />• Smiles to himself whenever he leaves or enters the room.<br />• My advice: “ Be coooool”.<br />• Our sole link with Shainu.</p>

<p>* Torchlight= Is a person who sees you coming from the opposite side,keeps on walking towards you without meeting your gaze,almost reaches parallel to you, then turns slightly, acts as though it is  surprising to see you, gives a 70 mm smile, turns back, switches the smile off, and walks off…he he.</p>
<p>19. NOOPUR  ( CRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrr…)</p>
<p>• Like Shaji did the thankless job of a CR where you get bad vibes from both sides (staff and          associates).<br />• A person in the group who spoke her mind if my ideas were haywire. So obviously we did not     jell well.<br />• The Noopur I saw in the 1st 2 weeks of ILP was very different. As I pride myself in being able      to categories associates, she was a puzzle.<br />• I learnt to stop giving always-negative comments to people, from my project team                       experiences. I learnt that it is not necessary to cut, negate, or object vehemently someone who   thinks you are wrong, even when they are right and vice-versa. I do not deny that noops gave a   lot of practice. Ha ha.<br />• Jokes apart, she was very nice to get along with in the end. Hope no hard feelings are left           behind…<br />• Seen mostly with Chandana n sruthi.</p>
<p>20. SANJANA </p>
<p>• Had a strong Kannur accent and colloquial usage of words,   when she came, that  all liked her       at once.<br />• The only “dimple” in class.<br />• I have heard that she has a peculiar way of implying  “Mach Nicsht”.</p>
<p>21.CHANDANA                                                                                                          <br />• Introduced us to the sweet world of Bengolee Music .<br />• Good singer.<br />• Had trouble with the gender usage in Hindi, which was cute.<br />• Html person of her team.<br />• Arogya calls her by “Tante”</p>
<p>22.LEKSHMI</p>
<p>• Always bubbling with energy.<br />• Addicted to mobile usage inside lab.<br />• Seen around Pallav Kumar, ensuring he and Rohin do their work.<br />• Makes you feel at ease.</p>
<p>23.MANEESHA</p>
<p>• I always considered her to be of the nervous type but boy was I wrong when she shocked the       daylights out of us with her Seminar.<br />• Easy to talk to, down to earth person.<br />• Got tickets back to Trivandrum for a lazy fellow like me.</p>
<p>Last but not the least by any means…</p>
<p>24.DIVYA (Da)</p>
<p>• The only female associate I dare give a nickname.<br />• Because of strict “eating schedules” she always ensured that we weren’t wasting any time            during Project “discussions”.<br />• Even when she had to go she ensured that she did double the work that was expected from          her.<br />• She and Noopur did most of the drawing work. So thanks a lot !<br />• Uses “ You know what” phrase a lot .<br />• Feared that she would end up in Coimbatore. A fact that was well utilized by Arogya and             Dileep.</p>
<p>25. Monu (Mad Monu)  </p>
<p>                                                                                                         (by Sandy)</p>
<p> Sorry for spoiling a great work by Monu but I couldn’t prevent writing about a great personality in C07 and that is MONU.</p>
<p>• Has a special ability to read faces, and sometimes hearts!!!!<br />• Is like Fire Extinguisher “Works well under Fire”<br />• Likes to spend time in updating batabase with me, unfortunately both of us share same                primary key.<br />• Tremendous sense of humor.<br />• A gentlemen at heart but a wild man outside…<br />• Loves to eat burgers &amp; Kairili food<br />• Unbiased fella.<br />• Wonderful Integrator, the way he integrated different pieces of codes to run a single module      was great……<br />• All and all A mad guy and heart of C07</p>
<p>PS: THE OPINIONS, COMMENTS, NICKNAMES ETC GIVEN  ABOVE HAVE BEEN ADDED SO THAT THIS HOPEFULLY                    BRINGS A LITTLE SMILE ON YOUR FACE WHILE READING THIS . IF YOU STILL GET OFFENDED THEN JUST REMEMBER THIS  BOY HAS JUST ONE THING TO SAY “MACH NISCHT”!!!</p>
<p>Auf Wiedersen !</p>
