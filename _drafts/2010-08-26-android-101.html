excerpt: Android setup issues.

<p><em><strong>S</strong></em>o finally I got to work on the awesome Android development platform. One thing I really like about Android is that I can use my Eclipse set up for Android development. To be specific I am using Eclipse galileo, I got "Hello World"Android up and running in 30 mins (it takes about 15 mins for Android to configure itself).</p>
<p>Some of the issues I came across were<br />
1) Could not find HelloAndroid.apk! :<br />
I backtraced the issue and found out that the Android SDK was not able to find the java sdk, so I added the Java sdk path to the Windows class path and the error disappeared.</p>
<p>2) [2010-06-15 11:19:15 - Emulator] emulator: ERROR: unknown virtual device name: 'my_avd'<br />
[2010-06-15 11:19:15 - Emulator] emulator: could not find virtual device named 'my_avd'<br />
ans) I am using windows 7 as development platform (I know windows suck but  can't help), I had to copy the .android folder from<br />
C:UsersAdministrator to C:Users&lt;user&gt; and the error was taken care of.</p>
<p>[Another way of doing it is change the permissions on the C:UsersAdministrator.android folder, give it full read write control]</p>
<p>So far so good, I am happy with my Android setup.</p>

<p>Debugging Tips:</p>
<p>Following are the steps to debug  javascript on Android simulator:</p>
<p>1) Using the command prompt go to the location where Android is installed, go to the tools directory.</p>
<p>2) Run the following command line command</p>
<p><em>&gt;adb devices</em></p>
<p>3) This command will display all the android simulators running e.g.</p>
<p><em>&gt;List of devices attache<br />
&gt;emulator-5554   device</em></p>
<p>4) Then use the following command to display the log</p>
<p><em>&gt;adb -s emulator-5554 logcat Browser</em></p>
<p>5) logcat command displays the log, you have an option to filter the logs, I wanted only the browser output hence I used [Browser] as filter variable.</p>
